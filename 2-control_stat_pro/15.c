//write a c program to determine eligibility for admission to a professional course based on the following criteria eligibility criteria :marks in maths >=65 and marks in phy >=55 and marks in chem >=50 and total in all three subject >=190 or total in maths  and physics>=140 -------------- input the marks obtained in physics : 65 input the marks obtained  in chemistry  :51 input the marks obtained in mathematics : 72 total marks of maths , physics and chemistry:188 total marks of maths and physics :137 the candidate is not eligible.
